Passwords are everywhere. We are drowning in passwords. You have too many of them to realistically and easily manage.   That's one of the main reasons people create weak passwords.  There are just too many to manage.

## C'YaPass Is Everywhere
That's why I've developed C'YaPass for use on every platform (Android, iOS, Windows and now you can even run it right in your browser from cyapass.com).

Make this the year you stop creating and memorizing passwords and let C'YaPass do it for you.

Try it in your browser, right now.  Just click this link and it'll open in a new tab/window: <a href="http://cyapass.com/" target="_blank">CYaPass web[^]</a>

## Browser Version Works In All Major Browsers
C'YaPass works in MS Edge, Brave, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera Software Opera.
I'm even testing it in the LadyBird browser and it works there.
There are no more excuses for not using strong passwords.  Try out the software in your browser right now, here at this web site.

## Try It and Help Yourself Have Stronger Passwords
I hope you'll try it and help yourself with all your password management.
Remember, C'YaPass never transmits your passwords nor stores them anywhere.  It simply generates a strong password for your use.

## Browser Version Uses HTML5 Canvas
The browser version does not require installation of anything.  It does not use Flash.  It runs in your browser via HTML5 Canvas.
